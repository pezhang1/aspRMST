Description: Calculates the estimated difference in adjusted SPs and the difference in adjusted RMSTs via treatment-stratified Cox proportional hazards models. Standard error estimates of these estimated differences are also provided. Sample size, power, and effect size calculations are also included, as well as function to analyze data using ASPs and ARMSTs.
