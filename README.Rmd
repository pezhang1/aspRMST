# Introduction
Clinical trials often involve the analysis of time-to-event data
to determine the efficacy of a treatment.
In the presence of baseline covariates, the hazard ratio (HR) under the Cox proportional hazards model is often used to quantify treatment effects. 
However, when the HR is nonproportional over time, 
a Cox PH model may lead to incorrect conclusions;
#because the resulting estimates of the HR depend on the follow-up duration and censoring distribution;
the interpretation of the HR estimate becomes less useful clinically in this context as well 
As an alternative summary measure to the HR for describing the magnitude of the treatment effect,
the difference in survival probabilities ({\bf SPs}) at a fixed follow-up time has been proposed 
to quantify the difference in survival outcomes between treatment arms.
The SP measure remains clinically interpretable even when survival curves have NPH,
facilitating communications between physicians and patients.. 

An alternative yet useful summary measure is the
restricted mean survival time (RMST) at time $\tau$,
also called $\tau$-year mean survival time,
which is the mean survival time of all subjects
in the study population followed up to the
specific time point $\tau$. 
The restricted time is often considered, 
as information on patient outcomes may not be available
beyond a certain time point due to limited study follow-up. 
The RMST summarizes the temporal event time distribution
during the time interval [0, $\tau$] and corresponds
to the area under the survival curve up to
the survival time $\tau$. 
The RMST is an alternative summary measure to the survival function
and provides information beyond the
survival probability only at a single time point

The goal of aspRMST is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of aspRMST like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(aspRMST)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
