\description{
Sample size calculation for testing survival probability difference adjusted for binary covariates
}
\details{
Calculates the sample size for testing survival probability difference given power and effect size via Monte Carlo simulation.
 See Details section in \code{\link{Imaxasp}} on how trial data are simulated.
 By using MC replicate datasets with an initial sample size M, we can calculate
 \eqn{V_{0}^M=1/I_{0}^M} and \eqn{V_{effect}^M=1/I_{effect}^M}, which represent the variances
 of the estimated differences in M patient trials.
 Under the large sample normal distribution for the effect size estimator,
  the required sample size depends on the unit variance,
  which is the reciprocal of the amount of information contributed by a single patient.
  To obtain the unit variances under the null and targeted alternative hypotheses,
   \eqn{V_{0}^1} and \eqn{V_{effect}^1}, we rescale \eqn{V_{0}^M} and \eqn{V_{effect}^M} by calculating
\eqn{V_{0}^1 = V_{0}^M \cdot M } and \eqn{V_{effect}^1 = V_{effect}^M \cdot M }.
With the individual variances per patient, we can calculate the actual required total sample size N for the trial using the equation
\deqn{N = \frac{\left(z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{V_0^1} + z_{\pi} \sqrt{V_{effect}^1}\right)^2}{effect^2},}
