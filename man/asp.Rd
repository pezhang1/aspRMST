\title{Adjusted SP}
\usage{
asp(t0, Time, Status, Z, TRT)
}
\arguments{
\item{t0}{- Pre-specified time point of analysis}

\item{Time}{- Observed times}

\item{Status}{- Event indicator (0 = censored, 1 = observed)}

\item{Z}{- Non-treatment group covariates}

\item{TRT}{- Treatment group indicator (0 = control, 1 = treatment)}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item SPD - Adjusted SP difference estimate
  \item SED - Standard error estimate of adjusted SP difference estimate
  \item S0 - Adjusted SP estimate for treatment group 0
  \item S1 - Adjusted SP estimate for treatment group 1
  \item SE0 - Standard error estimate of adjusted SP estimate for treatment group 0
  \item SE1 - Standard error estimate of adjusted SP estimate for treatment group 1
}
}
\description{
Calculates the adjusted SP difference between two treatment groups
at a pre-specified time point via a treatment-stratified Cox proportional hazards model.
Standard error estimates for the estimated difference are also calculated.
Adjusted SP estimates and standard error estimates
are also provided for each group.
