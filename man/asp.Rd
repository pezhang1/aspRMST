\title{Adjusted survival probability}
\usage{
asp(t0, Time, Status, Z, TRT)
}
\arguments{
\item{t0}{- pre-specified time point of analysis}

\item{Time}{- Observed imes}

\item{Status}{- Censoring status (0 = censored, 1 = observed)}

\item{Z}{- Non-treatment group covariates}

\item{TRT}{- Treatment group indicator (0 = control, 1 = treatment)}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item SPD - adjusted survival probability difference estimate
  \item SED - standard error estimate of adjusted survival probability difference estimate
  \item S0 - adjusted survival probability estimate for treatment group 0
  \item S1 - adjusted survival probability estimate for treatment group 1
  \item SE0 - standard error estimate of adjusted survival probability estimate for treatment group 0
  \item SE1 - standard error estimate of adjusted survival probability estimate for treatment group 1
}

\description{
Calculates the adjusted survival probability difference between two treatment groups
at a pre-specified time point via a treatment-stratified Cox proportional hazards model.
Standard error estimates for the estimated difference are also calculated.
Adjusted survival probability estimates and standard error estimates
are also provided for each group.

t0 = 1
TRT = c(rep(0,5),rep(1,5))
Z = cbind(rnorm(10))

CT = c(0.20, 0.8, 0.73, 0.24, 0.5, 0.25, 1.3, 3.6, 10, 20.5)
X = pmin(FT,CT)
Status = as.numeric(FT <= CT)     & (X <= t0)
Time = pmin(X,t0)
