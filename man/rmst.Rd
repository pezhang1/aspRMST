\title{RMST}
\usage{
rmst(t0, Time, Status, Z, TRT)
}
\arguments{
\item{t0}{- Pre-specified time point, RMST estimate is calculated over(0, t0)}

\item{Time}{- Observed times}

\item{Status}{- Event indicator (0 = Censored, 1 = Observed)}

\item{Z}{- Non-treatment group covariates}

\item{TRT}{- Treatment group indicator (0 = Control, 1 = Treatment)}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item muD - Adjusted SP difference estimate
  \item SED - Standard error estimate of adjusted SP difference estimate
  \item mu0 - Adjusted SP of treatment group 0
  \item mu1 - Adjusted SP of treatment group 1
  \item SE0 - Standard error of adjusted SP of treatment group 0
  \item SE1 - Standard error of adjusted SP of treatment group 1
}
}
\description{
Calculates RMST difference between two treatment groups
at a pre-specified time point via a treatment-stratified Cox proportional hazards model.
Standard error estimates for the estimated differences are also calculated.
RMST estimates and standard error estimates
are also provided for each group.
