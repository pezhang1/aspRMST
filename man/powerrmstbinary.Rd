\description{
Power calculation for testing restricted mean survival time difference adjusted for binary covariates
}
\details{
Calculates the power for testing survival probability difference given the sample size and effect size.
See Details section in \code{\link{Imaxasp}} on how trial data are simulated.
By using MC Monte Carlo replicates of datasets of total sample size N,
\eqn{I_{0}^N} and \eqn{I_{effect}^N} can be calculated,
which are the  information for a trial with total sample size N
 under the null hypothesis with effect size 0 and under a targeted alternative hypothesis
 where the effect size is \eqn{effect}, respectively.
This allows us to calculate \eqn{V_{0}^N = 1/I_{0}^N} and
  \eqn{V_{effect}^N=1/I_{effect}^N}, which are the variance of the estimated difference
   under the respective null and targeted alternative hypotheses for a fixed sample trial
    with total sample size N.
Using the large sample normal distribution of the effect size estimators, the power
 \eqn{\pi} can be expressed as
\deqn{\pi = \Phi \left(\frac{effect \sqrt{N} - z_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{V_0^N}}{\sqrt{V_{effect}^N}}\right),}
  where \eqn{\alpha} is the targeted type I error rate and \eqn{z_q=\Phi^{-1}(q)}
   for any \eqn{q \in (0,1)}.
