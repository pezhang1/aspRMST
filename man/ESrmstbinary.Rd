\description{
Effect size calculation for testing restricted mean survival time difference adjusted for binary covariates
}
\details{
Calculates the effect size for testing survival probability difference given sample size and power via Monte Carlo simulation.
 See Details section in \code{\link{Imaxasp}} on how trial data are simulated.
  Because the targeted effect size impacts the sample size formula through the two terms
   \eqn{effect} and \eqn{V_{effect}^N},
    we use an iterative procedure to obtain the required \eqn{effect}.
We first calculate an initial variance in the treatment group, \eqn{V_{10}^N},
by calculating \eqn{I_{0}^N} and initializing \eqn{V_{10}^N = 1/I_{0}^N}.
Then, the initial effect size is calculated as
\deqn{effect_0 = z_{1-\alpha/2} \sqrt{V_0^N} + z_{\pi} \sqrt{V_{10}^N}.}
Using this effect size, \eqn{V_{effect_0}^N} is calculated by taking the reciprocal
 of the information for a trial with effect size \eqn{effect_0}.
 \eqn{V_{10}^N} is then updated to \eqn{V_{effect_0}^N}.
 This updating of \eqn{effect_0} and \eqn{V_{10}^N} is repeated
